	<head>This is the COMIC PAGE!!!  Okay?!?!?
	<title>Title of Index</title>

	<p>This is the content of the INDEX. It's just a paragraph.</p>
	<p>For the index, there will be a short explaination of the comic. Something written all drama-like along the lines of "A hero, A dilema, A woman, A gun...Will they have what it takes to defeat this enemy, dawg?!"</p>
	<p>Now that I think about it, it would probably be a good idea to make a bio page about Sasaki. #NoteToSelf
